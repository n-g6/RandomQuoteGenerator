            <h2>What is this app?</h2>
            <p>This little app is the first of 20 programming projects I have set out to do.</p>
            <p>It operates by fetching a quote from an API found on the internet, transforming it a tiny bit and displaying it in a readable and pleasant to look at format.</p>
            <p>A bit of practice with the "onload" and "onclick" events can be seen through the two types of quotes which generate:
                <ul>
                    <li>The top ones which generate on page load</li>
                    <li>The bottom ones which generate at the click of the "Generate" button</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Due to my lack of almost any web-focused JS knowledge, the script is pretty basic and is in part written while following tutorials.</p>
